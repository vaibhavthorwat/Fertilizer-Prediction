#Fertilizer-Prediction

#Description:
Fertilizer prediction using Python involves preprocessing data on soil composition, crop type, and weather conditions to train a machine learning model. This project aims to predict the optimal type and amount of fertilizer required for specific crops using machine learning techniques.

#Project Structure:
1:Fertilizer Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook used for training the fertilizer prediction model.
2:main.py: Script to load the trained model and make predictions.
3:fertilizer.pkl: Trained fertilizer recommendation model (to be generated).
4:classifier.pkl: Trained classifier model (to be generated).
5:requirement.txt: File containing the list of required Python libraries.
6:Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/governance-at-your-door.git

#Setup Instructions:
1:Download and Install Required Libraries==>  pip install -r requirement.txt
2:Train the Model-Open the Fertilizer Prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells to train the models. This will generate fertilizer.pkl and classifier.pkl files.
3:Move Generated Files-Delete any existing fertilizer.pkl and classifier.pkl files in the project folder. Move the newly generated fertilizer.pkl and classifier.pkl files from your local machine to the project folder.
4:Run the Main Script  ==> python main.py

#Files Description:
1:Fertilizer Prediction.ipynb: Notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
2:fertilizer.pkl: Serialized model for fertilizer prediction.
3:classifier.pkl: Serialized classifier model.
4:requirement.txt: List of required libraries for the project.
5:main.py: Script to load the models and perform predictions.

#Notes:
1:Ensure that the fertilizer.pkl and classifier.pkl files are in the same directory as main.py.
2:Update the requirement.txt file if additional libraries are required.

#Technologies Used:
1:Python: Programming language used for developing the project.
2:Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
3:NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
4:Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating models.
5:Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running the Fertilizer Prediction.ipynb notebook.

#Credits:
This project was developed by Vaihav Thorwat and Rushikesh Lokhande as a part of Fertilizer Prediction.
